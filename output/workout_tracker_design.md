This `workout_tracker` module outlines a class-based design for the fitness workout tracking system, including exercise management, workout logging, and foundational structures for progress tracking, analytics, and goal setting. The provided classes and methods are designed to be functional and extensible, with room for additional features such as advanced reporting and body metrics tracking that can be implemented later.
